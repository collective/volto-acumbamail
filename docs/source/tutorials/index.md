# Custom REST services

Plone can expose specific endpoints for Volto. These services encapsulate
the logic for communicating with `Acumbamail` and provide a standardised format
for the front end.

---

(acumbamail-settings-route)=
## @acumbamail-settings route

Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with ``plone.restapi`` (there is a special permission).

To avoid enabling registry access to everyone, this package exposes a dedicated RestApi route with ``Acumbamail`` settings: *@acumbamail-settings*:

Get the information from the ``Acumbamail`` settings via `curl` command:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/Plone/@controlpanels/acumbamail-settings \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --user admin:admin
```

This route returns a JSON object containing the ``Acumbamail`` settings and data via `curl` command:

```json
{
  "@id": "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@controlpanels/acumbamail-settings",
  "data": {
    "api_key": null,
    "api_url": null,
    "list_id": null
  },
  "group": "Add-on Configuration",
  "schema": {
    "fieldsets": [
      {
        "behavior": "plone",
        "description": "",
        "fields": [
          "api_url",
          "api_key",
          "list_id"
        ],
        "id": "general",
        "title": "General settings"
      }
    ],
    "properties": {
      "api_key": {
        "description": "Your Acumbamail personal token (https://acumbamail.com/api/)",
        "factory": "Text line (String)",
        "title": "API Key",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "api_url": {
        "description": "The URL of the Acumbamail API endpoint.",
        "factory": "Text line (String)",
        "title": "API URL",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "list_id": {
        "description": "Numeric identifier of the list where subscribers will be added.",
        "factory": "Text line (String)",
        "title": "List ID",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "api_url",
      "api_key",
      "list_id"
    ],
    "type": "object"
  },
  "title": "Acumbamail Settings"
}
```

Below is a `PATCH` operation to set up the `api_url`, `api_key` and `list_id` fields values of the
``Acumbamail`` settings:

```shell
curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/Plone/@controlpanels/acumbamail-settings \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"api_url": "https://acumbamail.com/api/1/addSubscriber", "api_key": "204615m3a78w2fgt3t1nm34567890123", "list_id": "4702726"}' \
  --user admin:admin
```

This route returns a HTTP response:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Connection: close
Date: Sat, 25 Jul 2026 10:00:18 GMT
Server: waitress
Via: waitress
X-Powered-By: Zope (www.zope.dev), Python (www.python.org)
```

That means you were updated the values in the ``Acumbamail`` settings control panel fields correctly!

**NOTE:** You can validate the update operation, going to ``Site setup > Add-on settings > Acumbamail settings``.

(acumbamail-subscribe-route)=
## @acumbamail-subscribe route

Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with ``plone.restapi`` (there is a special permission).

To avoid enabling registry access to everyone, this package exposes a dedicated RestApi route called
`@acumbamail-subscribe`, below is a `POST` operation to add a new subscriber to the mailing list:

```shell
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/Plone/@acumbamail-subscribe \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Language: es" \
  --data '{"email": "user@example.com"}' \
  --user admin:admin
```

This `route` can be used in for a _Volto integration_ form componet.

**NOTE:** You can validate the add operation, going to your ``Acumbamail`` Dashboard account.
